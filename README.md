# Slider 15 
## [PLAY](https://nelliesnoodles.github.io/slider15/)
Modified from the slider9 version, the code did not have to be heavily modified to change the tile set from 9 - 16.  The tiles are hard coded into the html and are moved by clicking the tile you wish to move into the empty square.

As always feel free to take the code, break it, experiment with it, and have fun learning.
